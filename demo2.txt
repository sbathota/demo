Added the below content for feature1

You cannot create a branch for a single file in Git. 
When you create a branch, you create a branch for the entire repo. 
(Of course, unlike Subversion, a branch does not create actual on-disk copies of your files, 
so branches are cheap and don't take up as much extra space as a Subversion branch.)
